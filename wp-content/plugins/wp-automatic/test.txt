Hulk: Champions of the Universe[19459019] in uniting Marvel's biggest heroes with the ComiXology platform.

Now, it’s up to Wade to complete his victim’s mission as only he can – with excessive violence, an accelerated healing factor, and maybe, just maybe, a few laughs along the way.[19659018]“Deadpool is one of the most darkly comedic anti-heroes out there, and I’m so excited for fans to see him portray a spy in this new digital comic series,” said Chip Mosher, comiXology’s Head of Content. “With buzz over Deadpool still resounding, you won’t want to miss reading his next adventure!”[19659019]Last year, Marvel Comics joined comiXology Unlimited, giving fans the ability to read thousands of Marvel Comics single issues and collections as part of their comiXology Unlimited membership – featuring Super Heroes like the Avengers, Daredevil, Jessica Jones, Black Panther, Iron Fist, Guardians of the Galaxy and more.[19659020]This new series is only the latest odd adventure starring the Merc With a Mouth, and believe it or not, might actually be a bit more believable than usual (even if it is based on Deadpool accidentally killing Jason Bourne and taking on his mission). It may be a smaller-scale epic than say, [19459048]Deadpool holding the key to saving the universe[19459008], and a bit more tailored to his actual skills as a mercenary than [19459049]Deadpool's new power triggering superhero vomit[19459008].
